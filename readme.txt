RACE! is a Neo Geo Pocket (NGP) and Neo Geo Pocket Color (NGPC) emulator for
multiple platforms.
===================================================================================

Known Issues:
-------------
Must exit emulator using L+R to make sure save-game file gets written
Missing file selector
No emulator state saving


Portability:
------------
The GP2X and PC versions use SDL.  The code should be very portable to any
Little Endian system.  If your system is Big Endian, the TLCS900h core may
be problematic.

Please contact Flavor if you have any interest in porting RACE! to another system.
